# Connect-four

This is a WIP (a will likely stay ASIS), the goal was to understand better
minimax and optimisation algorithms for another project.

I followed this great article most of the time: http://blog.gamesolver.org/.


## Entry points

```
cargo run # play connect four
```

- <kbd>I</kbd> let the IA play next move
- <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd> move cursor
- <kbd>↓</kbd>/<kbd>⏎</kbd> drop a piece


```
cargo run --bin benchmark
```

Benchmarks the solver.
